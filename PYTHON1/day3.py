# # collection
# # Python Collections (Arrays)
# # There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# # List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# # Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# # Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# # Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
# # LISTS[]
# fruits = ["apples", "strawberry",1, "oranges",4, "apples"]
# print(type(fruits))

# # To loop through a list

# for x in fruits:
#     print(x)

# for x in range(len(fruits)):
#     print(fruits[x])


# # TUPLES()
# tup1 = ("apples",1, "strawberry",True,1, "oranges")


# # print(type(tup1))

# # conv = list(tup1)
# # # trying a list method

# # conv.remove(1)
# # print(conv)

# # conv.insert(1, 'banana')
# # print(conv)

# # conv.append("melon")
# # print(conv)

# # conv.remove('oranges')
# # print(conv)

# # conv.pop(4)
# # print(conv)

# ## OR
# # del conv[4]
# # print(conv)

# # ## To completely delete a LIST,
# # # del conv
# # # print(conv)

# # ANOTHER TUPLE
# for x in range(0,10,1): #start, stop, step
#     print(x)
